The issue was caused by increased resource contention in the subsystem responsible for the propagation of ENI network mappings within the affected Availability Zone. Engineers worked to identify the root cause of the resource contention and took steps to resolve it. By 7:45 PM PDT, ENI attachment times had returned to low single digit minute levels, which allowed most workflows to proceed and limited the impact to other AWS services. Some internal services, such as EMR, weighted away from the affected Availability Zone, which mitigated the impact. ENI attachment times continued to improve as the resource contention issue was addressed, and by 12:50 AM PDT, ENI attachment times had returned to normal levels. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally."

            "fullDescription": "Starting at 4:11 AM PST some EC2 instances and EBS volumes experienced a loss of power in a single data center within a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region. Instances in other data centers within the affected Availability Zone, and other Availability Zones within the US-EAST-1 Region were not affected by this event. At 4:55 AM PST, power was restored to EC2 instances and EBS volumes in the affected data center, which allowed the majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes to recover. However, due to the nature of the power event, some of the underlying hardware experienced failures, which needed to be resolved by engineers within the facility. Engineers worked to recover the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes affected by the issue. By 2:30 PM PST, we recovered the vast majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes. However, some of the affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes were running on hardware that has been affected by the loss of power and is not recoverable. For customers still waiting for recovery of a specific EC2 instance or EBS volume, we recommend that you relaunch the instance or recreate the volume from a snapshot for full recovery. If you need further assistance, please contact AWS Support."
